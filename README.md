## Intro:
The language that we will be implementing for this project will 
called Popper. It will have a Stack-Based language paradigm and
will be capable of manipulating strings as lists of chars,
handling int and boolean values, and handling functions created
by the users.

## Expected Output:

| Input | Output |

| PushN 12 <br/> PushN 3 <br/> Subtract |9 |
| PushN 12 <br/> PushN 3 <br/> Multiply |36 |
| PushN 12 <br/> PushN 3 <br/> Divide |4 |
